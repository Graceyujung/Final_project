## üõçÔ∏è Project Overview: E-Commerce User Behavior

This project explores user behavior in a multi-category e-commerce store using clickstream data collected from October 2019 to November 2019.

**Goal:**  
To identify behavioral patterns that indicate a user's likelihood to make a purchase and predict purchases using session-level features.

**Main Research Questions:**
- What user behaviors (views, carts, category depth) most influence purchasing?
- Can we build a model to predict if a session will lead to a purchase?
- What insights can help optimize the platform‚Äôs recommendation system or retargeting strategy?
